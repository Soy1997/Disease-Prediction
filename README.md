# Disease Prediction Model 🩺

This project is a **Disease Prediction Model** built in **Google Colab** using machine learning techniques. The goal of this project is to predict potential diseases based on given symptoms or medical data, providing a step toward early detection and healthcare assistance.

## 🔍 Key Features

* Implemented in **Python** with **Google Colab** for easy accessibility
* Uses **machine learning algorithms** to classify and predict diseases
* Data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training included
* Provides user-friendly predictions based on input symptoms
* Can be extended with more datasets and algorithms for higher accuracy

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
* Google Colab

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Improving prediction accuracy with deep learning
* Adding more diseases and symptoms to the dataset
* Building a simple web/app interface for real-time usage
